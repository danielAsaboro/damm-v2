the problem is on the streamflow interactions; 

⏺ I'll analyze the Streamflow integration to find the root cause of these test failures.

⏺ Now let me look at how the mock streamflow data is being created and what the Streamflow SDK is expecting:

⏺ Bash(grep -r "net_amount_deposited\|available_to_claim" /Users/user/development/solana/bounties/fee_router --include="*.toml"
      --include="*.lock" -A 2 -B 2)
  ⎿  No matches found

  ⎿  streamflow-sdk = { version = "0.10", features = ["cpi"] }

⏺ Now let me check if there are test logs to see what the actual error is:

⏺ Read(tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts)
  ⎿  Read 80 lines

⏺ Bash(find /Users/user/.cargo -name "streamflow-sdk*" -type d 2>/dev/null | head -5)

     … +39 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now I see the problem! Let me check the complete Contract structure:

         /// Magic bytes
         pub magic: u64,
     … +97 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now I understand the root cause. Let me check the byte layout to understand the serialization:

⏺ Bash(cat /Users/user/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/streamflow-sdk-0.10.0/src/state.rs | grep -B 5 -A 5

     /// Prefix used to derive Escrow account address
     … +7 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now I have identified the ROOT CAUSE! Let me create the plan.

  Root Cause Analysis

  The test failures showing expected +0 to be above +0 indicate that investors are receiving zero tokens in distributions. This is the
  symptom.

  The root cause is in tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts:148-180 in the createStreamflowAccountData() function:

  Current Implementation (BROKEN):
  function createStreamflowAccountData(params: {...}): Buffer {
    const buffer = Buffer.alloc(1000);  // ❌ WRONG SIZE
    let offset = 0;

    // Write locked amount in first 8 bytes (little-endian)
    const lockedBuffer = lockedAmount.toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 8);
    lockedBuffer.copy(buffer, offset);  // ❌ COMPLETELY WRONG STRUCTURE
    offset += 8;

    // Add some padding to make it look like a real account
    const padding = Buffer.alloc(992);
    padding.copy(buffer, offset);

    return buffer.slice(0, offset);
  }

  Why This is Wrong:

  1. Wrong size: Creates 1000-byte buffer, but Streamflow SDK expects METADATA_LEN = 1104 bytes
  2. Wrong structure: The code just writes the lockedAmount in the first 8 bytes and fills rest with zeros. This is NOT how the
  Streamflow Contract struct is serialized!
  3. The Streamflow SDK's Contract::deserialize() fails because the buffer doesn't match the real structure:
    - The Contract struct has many fields before ix.net_amount_deposited (magic, version, created_at, amount_withdrawn, canceled_at,
  end_time, sender, recipient, mint, multiple fee fields, etc.)
    - The real serialization order is: magic (8) + version (1) + created_at (8) + amount_withdrawn (8) + canceled_at (8) + end_time (8)
  + last_withdrawn_at (8) + sender (32) + sender_tokens (32) + recipient (32) + recipient_tokens (32) + mint (32) + ... +
  ix.net_amount_deposited + ix.period + ix.amount_per_period + ... and more fields
  4. When read_locked_amount_from_stream() is called in the Rust program:
    - It calls StreamflowContract::deserialize() which fails silently or returns garbage values
    - The available_to_claim() method depends on proper values in ix.net_amount_deposited, ix.amount_per_period, ix.period,
  effective_start_time(), pause_time(), etc.
    - Since these are all zeros or garbage, available_to_claim() returns 0
    - Therefore locked = total_deposited - available = 0 - 0 = 0
    - With all locked amounts = 0, the distribution formula gives 0 tokens to investors

> why is it doing like this? we fucking have the js sdk that should guide in constructing this thing from the js/ts ends, why aren't you
 leveraging on it fgs?? 

⏺ You're absolutely right! I was being stupid. The Streamflow JS SDK (@streamflow/stream) is already imported at the top of the file but
   NOT being used to create the mock accounts!

  Let me check how the JS SDK can help:

⏺ Perfect! I see Contract and decodeStream exported. Let me check those:

⏺ Bash(cat /Users/user/development/solana/bounties/fee_router/node_modules/@streamflow/stream/dist/esm/index-Dp5DXxr-.d.ts | grep -A 80

⏺ Now let me find how to encode/serialize the Contract:

⏺ Bash(cat /Users/user/development/solana/bounties/fee_router/node_modules/@streamflow/stream/dist/esm/index-Dp5DXxr-.d.ts | grep -B 5 -A 20
       "decodeStream")

      "encode\|serial" | head -20)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Good! So there's decodeStream but I need to find if there's an encode function. Let me check the actual implementation:

⏺ Bash(grep -r "encodeStream\|encode.*stream\|serialize"
      /Users/user/development/solana/bounties/fee_router/node_modules/@streamflow/stream/dist/esm/*.d.ts | head -20)

⏺ Let me check the actual JS implementation file to see how decodeStream works (maybe I can reverse it):

⏺User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Fix Plan: Use Streamflow JS SDK's BufferLayout to Properly Serialize Mock Accounts

     Root Cause: 
     The createStreamflowAccountData() function in tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts:148-180 creates invalid Streamflow account data by 
     just writing 8 bytes and padding. The Rust SDK's Contract::deserialize() fails, returning garbage values, causing 
     available_to_claim() to return 0, which makes all locked amounts = 0, resulting in 0 token distributions to investors.

     Solution:
     Use the BufferLayout from @solana/buffer-layout (same library used by Streamflow JS SDK) to properly encode the Contract struct 
     with all fields in the correct order.

     Implementation:
     1. Import @solana/buffer-layout in tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts
     2. Define the same streamLayout structure from Streamflow SDK (47 fields with correct types and sizes)
     3. Use streamLayout.encode() to serialize properly structured Contract data with:
       - Correct magic bytes, version, timestamps
       - All PublicKeys (sender, recipient, mint, escrow, etc.)
       - Critical fields: net_amount_deposited, start_time, period, amount_per_period, current_pause_start=0, pause_cumulative=0, 
     last_rate_change_time, funds_unlocked_at_last_rate_change=0
     4. This ensures the Rust SDK can deserialize and calculate correct available_to_claim() values

     Files to modify:
     - tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts (rewrite createStreamflowAccountData() function)

     This will fix all 12 failing tests.

⏺ Good progress! Now I need to mark the tasks complete and handle the warnings. The big numeric literal warning is fine (it's the magic
  bytes). Let me update the todos:

⏺ Perfect! The implementation is complete. Now let me explain the fix to the user:

  ✅ Fix Implemented

  I've rewritten the Streamflow mock account creation in
  /Users/user/development/solana/bounties/fee_router/tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts using the proper serialization approach.

  What Changed:

  Before (lines 148-180):
  - Just wrote 8 bytes (locked amount) + 992 bytes of zeros
  - Total garbage that the Rust SDK couldn't deserialize

  After (lines 144-298):
  1. Imported @solana/buffer-layout - the same library Streamflow SDK uses
  2. Defined streamLayout - exact 47-field structure matching Streamflow SDK's Contract struct
  3. Rewrote createStreamflowAccountData() to:
    - Calculate amount_per_period correctly for linear vesting
    - Set all required fields: magic bytes, version, timestamps, public keys
    - Critical fields for available_to_claim() calculation:
        - net_amount_deposited ✓
      - start_time ✓
      - period ✓
      - amount_per_period ✓
      - current_pause_start = 0 ✓
      - pause_cumulative = 0 ✓
      - last_rate_change_time ✓
      - funds_unlocked_at_last_rate_change = 0 ✓
    - Use streamLayout.encode() to properly serialize everything

  Why This Fixes The Tests:

  The Rust program's read_locked_amount_from_stream() (programs/fee_router/src/integrations/streamflow.rs:35-55) now:
  1. Successfully deserializes the Contract struct ✓
  2. Calls available_to_claim() with correct values ✓
  3. Returns proper locked = deposited - available ✓
  4. Fee distribution formula works correctly with non-zero locked amounts ✓

  Ready for you to test this in another terminal!

⏺ The error is clear - the magic bytes number 0x5354524d5f4d4554 is too large for JavaScript to handle as a safe integer! The BN.js
  library is rejecting it. I need to create the magic bytes as a Buffer directly instead of converting from a number.

⏺ Update(tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts)
  ⎿  Updated tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts with 1 addition and 1 removal                                                      
       241    
       242      // Prepare the data object matching the layout
       243      const streamData = {
       244 -      magic: new BN(0x5354524d5f4d4554).toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 8), // "STRM_MET" magic bytes
       244 +      magic: Buffer.from([0x54, 0x45, 0x4d, 0x5f, 0x4d, 0x52, 0x54, 0x53]), // "STRM_MET" magic bytes in little-endian
       245        version: Buffer.from([1]),
       246        created_at: new BN(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)).toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 8),
       247        withdrawn_amount: withdrawnAmount.toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 8),

⏺ Good! Fixed the magic bytes issue. Now the tests should be able to run. Let me mark the task as complete:

⏺ ✅ Fixed the Magic Bytes Overflow

  The issue was that 0x5354524d5f4d4554 is larger than JavaScript's Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER (2^53), so BN.js rejected it with "Assertion
   failed".

  Fix applied in streamflow.ts:244:
  // Before (broken):
  magic: new BN(0x5354524d5f4d4554).toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 8),

  // After (fixed):
  magic: Buffer.from([0x54, 0x45, 0x4d, 0x5f, 0x4d, 0x52, 0x54, 0x53]),

  Created the magic bytes directly as a Buffer instead of trying to convert a huge number through BN.js.

  The tests should now run! Ready for you to test in your terminal.

⏺ Good progress! The BN.js error is fixed. Now we have a different issue - "insufficient funds for rent". This is happening when
  creating the Streamflow account. The buffer size changed from 1000 bytes to the proper size (1104 bytes from streamLayout.span), so we
   need more lamports for rent.

  Let me check the rent calculation:

⏺ Read(tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts)
  ⎿  Read 25 lines

⏺ The rent calculation looks wrong. It's using rent.lamportsPerByteYear which is not the right formula. Solana's rent exemption
  calculation should use the proper method. Let me fix this:

⏺ Update(tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts)
  ⎿  Updated tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts with 4 additions and 6 removals          
        99    
       100      // Create the account on-chain with proper ownership and data
       101      const rent = await banksClient.getRent();
       102 -    // Use a larger amount to ensure rent exemption (simple approach)
       103 -    const lamports = Math.max(
       104 -      Number(rent.lamportsPerByteYear) * streamData.length +
       105 -        Number(rent.exemptionThreshold),
       106 -      10000000 // 0.01 SOL minimum
       107 -    );
       102 +    // Calculate proper rent exemption for the account size
       103 +    // Formula: (dataSize + 128) * rent.lamportsPerByteYear
       104 +    // The 128 is for account overhead
       105 +    const lamports = Number(rent.minimumBalance(BigInt(streamData.length)));
       106    
       107      // Create account with initial data using SystemProgram.createAccount
       108      const createAccountIx = SystemProgram.createAccount({

⏺ Perfect! Fixed the rent calculation to use the proper rent.minimumBalance() method. This should now allocate the correct amount of
  lamports for the 1104-byte Streamflow account.

  The fix:
  - Before: Incorrect manual calculation using lamportsPerByteYear * length + exemptionThreshold
  - After: Use Solana's built-in rent.minimumBalance(dataSize) which handles all the proper calculations including overhead

  ⎿  Found 4 new diagnostic issues in 1 file (ctrl-o to expand)

⏺ Excellent progress! We went from 17 failing to 4 failing tests! The Streamflow deserialization is now working. However, there's still
  an issue with how the locked amounts are being calculated. Let me analyze the failures:

  1. Test expects locked amounts > 0, but getting 0
  2. HALF_LOCKED expects 50% to investors, but getting 100%
  3. MIXED_LOCKS expects locked > 10000, but getting exactly 10000
  4. MOSTLY_UNLOCKED expects 20% to investors, but getting 100%

  The pattern shows the locked percentages aren't being applied correctly. The issue is that we're NOT using the lockedAmountOverride
  parameter that was passed in! Let me check the code:

⏺ Read(tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

⏺ I see the problem! The lockedAmountOverride is being passed to createStreamflowAccountData() but never used. The function ignores it
  completely! The mock streams need to be set up so that when the Rust SDK calls available_to_claim(), it returns the correct value
  based on the desired locked percentage.

  The issue is that available_to_claim() depends on:
  - net_amount_deposited
  - start_time
  - period
  - amount_per_period
  - Current timestamp

  We need to manipulate these values to make the SDK return the right locked amount. The simplest approach: adjust the start_time and
  the current Clock timestamp to simulate vesting progress!

⏺ Read(tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts)
  ⎿  Read 75 lines

⏺ Now I understand the full picture. The code calculates vestedFraction and creates effectiveCurrentTime, but then ignores it and still
  uses the original vestingStartTime when calling createRealStreamflowStream.

  The Rust SDK's available_to_claim() will use the current blockchain timestamp (from the Clock sysvar) when calculating, NOT some fake
  time we write in the account. We need to manipulate the vesting schedule itself to produce the right locked percentage!

  The trick: adjust the start_time in the account to be in the past by just the right amount so that when available_to_claim()
  calculates with the current time, it returns the desired vested percentage.

> do you know you can warp time with bankrun?? Time travel
Many programs rely on the Clock sysvar: for example, a mint that doesn't become available until after a certain time. With bankrun you 
can dynamically overwrite the Clock sysvar using context.set_clock(). Here's an example using a program that panics if 
clock.unix_timestamp is greater than 100 (which is on January 1st 1970):

import { Clock, start } from "solana-bankrun";
import {
    PublicKey,
    Transaction,
    TransactionInstruction,
} from "@solana/web3.js";

test("clock", async () => {
    const programId = PublicKey.unique();
    const context = await start(
        [{ name: "bankrun_clock_example", programId }],
        [],
    );
    const client = context.banksClient;
    const payer = context.payer;
    const blockhash = context.lastBlockhash;
    const ixs = [
        new TransactionInstruction({ keys: [], programId, data: Buffer.from("") }),
    ];
    const tx = new Transaction();
    tx.recentBlockhash = blockhash;
    tx.add(...ixs);
    tx.sign(payer);
    // this will fail because it's not January 1970 anymore
    await expect(client.processTransaction(tx)).rejects.toThrow(
        "Program failed to complete",
    );
    // so let's turn back time
    const currentClock = await client.getClock();
    context.setClock(
        new Clock(
            currentClock.slot,
            currentClock.epochStartTimestamp,
            currentClock.epoch,
            currentClock.leaderScheduleEpoch,
            50n,
        ),
    );
    const ixs2 = [
        new TransactionInstruction({
            keys: [],
            programId,
            data: Buffer.from("foobar"), // unused, just here to dedup the tx
        }),
    ];
    const tx2 = new Transaction();
    tx2.recentBlockhash = blockhash;
    tx2.add(...ixs2);
    tx2.sign(payer);
    // now the transaction goes through
    await client.processTransaction(tx2);
});

⏺ OH! You're absolutely right! I was overcomplicating this. We can just warp the Clock sysvar to the time we need for each test, instead
   of manipulating the start_time in the Streamflow accounts!

  Let me revert my last change and instead use the simpler approach: keep the original vesting schedule in the accounts, and just set
  the Clock to the right timestamp before calling crankDistribution.

⏺ Good! Now I need to add code to actually SET the Clock. The problem is that with mixed lock percentages, each investor needs a
  different time. But we can only set ONE global Clock!

  The solution: set the Clock to a time that works for ALL streams, which means we need all streams to use the SAME vesting schedule
  with the SAME start/end times, and then warp the Clock to a single target time. But wait - the test passes different locked
  percentages per investor...

  Actually, looking back at the code, I see the issue now. The tests ALL use the same vestingStartTime and vestingEndTime for all
  investors. So we can pick ONE target time for the Clock. But which one?

  For scenarios like MIXED_LOCKS with [100, 75, 50, 25, 0], we can't use a single Clock time to achieve all those percentages with the
  same vesting schedule!

  The real solution: Each stream needs its OWN start_time adjusted so that at the SAME Clock time, each stream has the right locked
  percentage. That's what my previous approach was doing! Let me restore it:

⏺ Perfect! Now the approach is:
  1. Each stream gets its own adjustedStartTime and adjustedEndTime based on the desired locked%
  2. When the Rust SDK reads these streams using the current blockchain time (from Clock sysvar), it will calculate the correct
  available_to_claim() for each stream
  3. This gives us the right locked amounts without needing to manipulate the Clock

  The fix is complete and should work now. Ready for you to test!

⏺ I see! The test uses Date.now() but the blockchain Clock uses context.banksClient.getClock().unixTimestamp. These could be different!
  The issue is in createInvestorStreams - it uses Date.now() for currentTime, but the Rust program will use the blockchain Clock sysvar.

  Let me fix this by getting the actual blockchain time:

  ⎿  Updated tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts with 3 additions and 1 removal            
       380      // Equal allocation to each investor
       381      const perInvestorAllocation = totalAllocation.div(new BN(investorCount));
       382    
       383 -    const currentTime = new BN(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000));
       383 +    // Get the actual blockchain time from the Clock sysvar
       384 +    const clock = await banksClient.getClock();
       385 +    const currentTime = new BN(Number(clock.unixTimestamp));
       386    
       387      for (let i = 0; i < investorCount; i++) {
       388        const recipient = Keypair.generate().publicKey;

⏺ Perfect! Now createInvestorStreams uses the actual blockchain Clock time, which matches what the Rust SDK will use when calculating
  available_to_claim(). This should fix the remaining 3 tests!

  Summary of the Fix

  The root cause was a time mismatch:
  - The test helper was using Date.now() / 1000 (JavaScript system time)
  - The Rust SDK was using the blockchain's Clock sysvar (clock.unix_timestamp)
  - These two times were different, causing incorrect locked percentage calculations

  The fix: Use banksClient.getClock().unixTimestamp to get the actual blockchain time, ensuring our adjusted start times align correctly
   with what the Rust SDK will see.

  Ready for you to test again!

⏺ Still 3 failing, and now MIXED_LOCKS has a "Program failed to complete" error. Let me investigate. The issue is likely that some of
  the adjusted start times are in the future or end times are in the past, which breaks the Streamflow SDK's validation.

  Let me check the Streamflow SDK's available_to_claim logic again and think about edge cases:

⏺ Read(tests/bankrun-utils/streamflow.ts)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

⏺ Wait, I think I see a fundamental issue. Looking back at the Rust SDK's available_to_claim() implementation, there's a key detail:

  pub fn available_to_claim(&self, now: u64, fee_percentage: f32) -> u64 {
      ...
      let vested_available = calculate_fee_from_amount(self.vested_available(now), fee_percentage);
      let cliff_available = calculate_fee_from_amount(self.cliff_available(now), fee_percentage);
      let sum_available = vested_available + cliff_available;
      sum_available - self.amount_withdrawn
  }

  It's applying fee calculations! And our Rust code calls it with fee_percentage = 0.0:

  let available = stream_contract.available_to_claim(current_timestamp_u64, 0.0);

  So that should be fine. But let me trace through the vesting calculation more carefully. The SDK uses vested_available() which depends
   on:
  - effective_start_time() which is max(last_rate_change_time, start_time())
  - start_time() which is cliff > 0 ? cliff : start_time

  We're setting cliff = 0, so start_time() returns our start_time. And we're setting last_rate_change_time = start_time, so
  effective_start_time() = start_time.

  Let me add some debug logging to see what's actually happening. Actually, let me first check if there's an issue with negative time
  calculations for 100% locked streams (where elapsedSeconds = 0):

  For lockedPercent = 100: vestedFraction = 0, elapsedSeconds = 0, adjustedStartTime = currentTime - 0 = currentTime

  That means at currentTime, the stream has elapsed = 0, which is correct for 100% locked!

  For lockedPercent = 0: vestedFraction = 1.0, elapsedSeconds = totalDuration, adjustedStartTime = currentTime - totalDuration

  That means the stream started totalDuration ago, so it's fully vested. That's also correct!

  The math looks right. Let me check if maybe the issue is that the Rust program is using a DIFFERENT timestamp than what we think. Let
  me look at the Rust code:

⏺ Read(programs/fee_router/src/instructions/crank_distribution.rs)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines

⏺ Good, so the Rust code gets current_time from Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp at line 142. That's exactly what we're now using! The
  timestamps should match.

  Let me think about what else could cause the issue. Wait - I just realized something. Looking at the test output, it says investors
  are getting 100% when they should get less. This means total_locked_all_investors is probably equal to total_deposited, which means
  ALL tokens appear fully locked.

  But wait - if the adjustedStartTime calculation is correct, why would that happen? Let me double-check the Streamflow SDK's vested
  calculation. Actually, I think the issue might be that when lockedPercent < 100, the adjustedStartTime is in the PAST, and if
  adjustedEndTime is also in the past, then the SDK thinks the stream is fully vested (0% locked), which is the opposite of what we
  want!

  Let me check for the edge case where adjustedEndTime < currentTime:

  For lockedPercent = 50:
  - elapsedSeconds = totalDuration * 0.5
  - adjustedStartTime = currentTime - totalDuration * 0.5
  - adjustedEndTime = adjustedStartTime + totalDuration = currentTime + totalDuration * 0.5

  That should be fine - end time is in the future.

  But wait! The test passes vestingStartTime and vestingEndTime, and we calculate totalDuration from those. But then we ignore them and
  use adjusted times! Let me trace through a specific example:

  Test HALF_LOCKED:
  - currentTime = Date.now() / 1000 (let's say 1700000000)
  - vestingStart = currentTime - 86400 * 180 (180 days ago)
  - vestingEnd = currentTime + 86400 * 180 (180 days future)
  - totalDuration = vestingEnd - vestingStart = 360 days
  - For lockedPercent = 50:
    - elapsedSeconds = 360 * 0.5 = 180 days
    - adjustedStartTime = currentTime - 180 days = vestingStart ✓
    - adjustedEndTime = adjustedStartTime + 360 days = vestingEnd ✓

  That looks right! So why is it failing? Let me add some debug output. Actually, wait - maybe the issue is that the test is using
  Date.now() but we're using clock.unixTimestamp. Let me check if the test needs updating too:

  Actually, looking at the test file at line 1411-1413, the test ALSO uses Date.now() to calculate vestingStart and vestingEnd. But our
  function now uses clock.unixTimestamp for currentTime. If those two are different, then our adjusted times won't align with what the
  test expects!

  The fix: the test should ALSO use the blockchain clock, not Date.now(). But wait - that's the test code, we can't change that easily.
  Let me think...

  Actually, the better approach: since ALL tests use the SAME pattern (calculate vesting times based on Date.now()), and they all pass
  those times to createInvestorStreams, maybe we should just use the passed-in vestingStartTime and vestingEndTime directly as our
  reference, rather than trying to recalculate based on currentTime!

  Let me revise the approach:
