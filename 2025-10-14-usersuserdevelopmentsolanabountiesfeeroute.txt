⏺ Perfect! I can see the issue now. The test is failing with QuoteOnlyValidationFailed error. Let me
  check the validation logic and the pool state to understand why:

⏺ Read(programs/fee_router/src/utils/validation.rs)
  ⎿  Read 85 lines

⏺ Read(programs/fee_router/src/cp_amm_types.rs)
  ⎿  Read 296 lines

⏺ Now I understand the issue! Looking at the comment on line 50 of cp_amm_types.rs:

  /// 0 is collect fee in both token, 1 only collect fee in token a, 2 only collect fee in token b
  pub collect_fee_mode: u8,

  But in the validation logic (validation.rs:17-24), we're checking that when collect_fee_mode == 1, the
   token_a_mint should equal the expected_quote_mint. However, according to the comment, mode 1 collects
   fees in token A.

  Let me check what the actual CP-AMM source says about this:

⏺ Search(pattern: "CollectFeeMode|collect_fee_mode", path: "programs/cp-amm/src", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 78 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now let me look at the actual CollectFeeMode enum definition and the FeeMode logic:

⏺ Read(programs/cp-amm/src/state/pool.rs)
  ⎿  Read 60 lines

⏺ Read(programs/cp-amm/src/state/fee.rs)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

⏺ Perfect! Now I understand the issue completely. Looking at the CP-AMM enum definition (pool.rs:43-48)
  and the FeeMode logic (fee.rs:426-434):

  pub enum CollectFeeMode {
      BothToken,  // = 0
      OnlyB,      // = 1
  }

  And the FeeMode::get_fee_mode logic shows:
  (CollectFeeMode::OnlyB, TradeDirection::AtoB) => (false, false), // fees_on_token_a = false
  (CollectFeeMode::OnlyB, TradeDirection::BtoA) => (true, false),  // fees_on_token_a = false

  So when collect_fee_mode = 1 (OnlyB), fees are NEVER collected on token_a (fees_on_token_a = false).
  The fees are collected on token_b (the output token based on trade direction).

  However, the comment on line 46 says "Only token B, we just need token B, because if user want to
  collect fee in token A, they just need to flip order of tokens". This is confusing but makes sense:
  when mode=1, you can only collect fees in one specific token. Which token that is depends on the TOKEN
   ORDERING in the pool.

  The real issue is that in our validation logic (validation.rs:17-24), we're checking that token_a_mint
   == expected_quote_mint when mode is 1. But actually, mode 1 collects fees in the OUTPUT token of
  swaps, not specifically token_a or token_b.

  Let me now present a complete plan to fix this issue:
                                                                                                       
⏺User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Plan to Fix Test Failures

     Root Cause

     The validation logic in validation.rs is incorrect. The CP-AMM's CollectFeeMode::OnlyB (mode 1) 
     doesn't collect fees in token_a as assumed. Looking at the FeeMode logic:
     - Mode 1 (OnlyB): collects fees on the OUTPUT token of swaps, which is token_b
     - The comment mentions "flip order of tokens" to collect in token_a, meaning you need to create the
      pool with reversed token order

     The Issue

     Current validation (validation.rs:17-24) checks:
     1 => {
         // OnlyB mode - collects fees only in tokenA  ← WRONG
         require_keys_eq!(pool.token_a_mint, *expected_quote_mint, ...);
     }

     Should be:
     1 => {
         // OnlyB mode - collects fees only in tokenB (not tokenA)
         require_keys_eq!(pool.token_b_mint, *expected_quote_mint, ...);
     }

     Changes Needed

     1. Fix validation.rs - Update validate_quote_only_pool() and determine_quote_mint() to correctly 
     map:
       - Mode 1 (OnlyB) → collects in token_b_mint (not token_a_mint)
       - Update comments to reflect actual behavior
     2. Fix test expectations - Update test in feeRouter.test.ts:
       - Test 1: Mode 1 with tokenA as quote → expects token_b_mint == quote (currently wrong setup)
       - Test 2: Mode 1 with flipped tokens → update token order expectations
     3. Rebuild and test - After fixes:
       - Run: anchor build -- --features local
       - Run tests: pnpm exec ts-mocha tests/feeRouter.test.ts
       - Verify all 7 tests pass

     Expected Outcome

     All tests should pass after correctly aligning the validation logic with CP-AMM's actual fee 
     collection behavior.
  ⎿

⏺ Great! Let me start by creating a todo list and then implementing the fixes:

⏺ Now let me fix the validation logic:

⏺ Update(programs/fee_router/src/utils/validation.rs)
  ⎿  Updated programs/fee_router/src/utils/validation.rs with 6 additions and 6 removals      
        8        expected_quote_mint: &Pubkey,
        9    ) -> Result<()> {
       10        // Check if pool is configured to collect fees only in one token
       11 -      // Based on CP-AMM's CollectFeeMode enum:
       11 +      // Based on CP-AMM's CollectFeeMode enum and FeeMode logic:
       12        // - 0 = BothToken: collects fees in both tokens (REJECT)
       13 -      // - 1 = OnlyB: collects fees only in tokenA (ACCEPT if quote_mint == tokenA)
       14 -      // The enum is confusingly named - "OnlyB" actually collects in tokenA
       13 +      // - 1 = OnlyB: collects fees only in tokenB (ACCEPT if quote_mint == tokenB)
       14 +      // The FeeMode logic shows that OnlyB mode collects fees on the OUTPUT token 
          + (tokenB)
       15        // Note: There is no mode 2, only 0 and 1 exist in the actual CP-AMM code
       16        match pool.collect_fee_mode {
       17            1 => {
       18 -              // OnlyB mode - collects fees only in tokenA
       19 -              // Token A should be our quote mint
       18 +              // OnlyB mode - collects fees only in tokenB (the output token)
       19 +              // Token B should be our quote mint
       20                require_keys_eq!(
       21 -                  pool.token_a_mint,
       21 +                  pool.token_b_mint,
       22                    *expected_quote_mint,
       23                    HonouraryError::QuoteOnlyValidationFailed
       24                );

⏺ Now let me fix the determine_quote_mint() function:

⏺ Update(programs/fee_router/src/utils/validation.rs)
  ⎿  Updated programs/fee_router/src/utils/validation.rs with 1 addition and 1 removal
       45    /// Determine which token is the quote token based on pool configuration
       46    pub fn determine_quote_mint(pool: &Pool) -> Result<Pubkey> {
       47        match pool.collect_fee_mode {
       48 -          1 => Ok(pool.token_a_mint),  // OnlyB mode - collects in tokenA
       48 +          1 => Ok(pool.token_b_mint),  // OnlyB mode - collects in tokenB
       49            0 => {
       50                // BothToken mode - not supported for quote-only pools
       51                Err(HonouraryError::InvalidPoolConfiguration.into())

⏺ Now I need to update the test to match the corrected logic. The first test creates a pool with
  collectFeeMode = 1 and passes tokenAMint and tokenBMint in that order. With mode 1, fees are collected
   in token_b_mint, so the quote mint should be tokenBMint (not tokenAMint):

⏺ Update(tests/feeRouter.test.ts)
  ⎿  Updated tests/feeRouter.test.ts with 5 additions and 5 removals                              
        95        });
        96    
        97        it("Should successfully initialize honorary position with quote-only pool 
             (collectFeeMode = 1)", async () => {
        98 -        // Create pool with collectFeeMode = 1 (OnlyTokenA)
        98 +        // Create pool with collectFeeMode = 1 (OnlyB - collects fees in tokenB)
        99          const createConfigParams: CreateConfigParams = {
       100            poolFees: {
       101              baseFee: {
     ...
       113            vaultConfigKey: PublicKey.default,

       115            activationType: 0,
       116 -          collectFeeMode: 1, // OnlyTokenA - quote only
       116 +          collectFeeMode: 1, // OnlyB - collects fees in tokenB only
       117          };
       118    
       119          const config = await createConfigIx(
     ...
       146              payer,
       147              vault,
       148              pool,
       149 -            quoteMint: tokenAMint, // TokenA is quote since collectFeeMode = 1
       150 -            baseMint: tokenBMint,
       149 +            quoteMint: tokenBMint, // TokenB is quote since collectFeeMode = 1 (OnlyB)
       150 +            baseMint: tokenAMint,
       151            });
       152    
       153          // Verify position owner was created
     ...
       159          expect(positionOwnerAccount.vault.toString()).to.equal(vault.toString());
       160          expect(positionOwnerAccount.pool.toString()).to.equal(pool.toString());
       161          expect(positionOwnerAccount.quoteMint.toString()).to.equal(
       162 -          tokenAMint.toString()
       162 +          tokenBMint.toString()
       163          );
       164          expect(positionOwnerAccount.positionAccount.toString()).to.equal(
       165            position.toString()

⏺ Now let me update the second test (the flipped tokens test). The comment says "flip tokens to collect
  fees in tokenA", so let me update it to be consistent with our new understanding:
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> sorry resume 

⏺ No problem! Let me continue updating the second test with flipped tokens:

⏺ Update(tests/feeRouter.test.ts)

⏺ Good! Now I need to also update the test in suite 3 that creates a quote-only pool. Let me check and
  update that:

⏺ Update(tests/feeRouter.test.ts)
  ⎿  Updated tests/feeRouter.test.ts with 4 additions and 4 removals

⏺ The error is 0x65 which is InstructionFallbackNotFound (error 101). This means the instruction is not
  being found. The issue is that after rebuilding, the IDL wasn't regenerated or the TypeScript code
  isn't calling the right instruction. Let me check the IDL:

     … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The IDL looks correct - it has initialize_honorary_position with snake_case. The issue is that Anchor
  should automatically convert this to camelCase in TypeScript (initializeHonoraryPosition). Let me
  check if the test is calling it correctly:

⏺ Bash(grep -n "initializeHonoraryPosition" tests/bankrun-utils/feeRouter.ts | head -5)
  ⎿  149:export async function initializeHonoraryPosition(
     189:    .initializeHonoraryPosition()

    laration expected.
    … +46 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



⏺ The TypeScript compilation errors are unrelated (dependency issues). The problem is different - the
  error 0x65 (InstructionFallbackNotFound) suggests that the instruction discriminator doesn't match.
  This happens when the program binary doesn't match the IDL. Let me check if there's a deployment
  issue. Let me try running the CP-AMM's test first to see if the CreateConfig instruction works:

⏺ Bash(pnpm exec ts-mocha tests/feeRouter.test.ts --grep "Should successfully setup policy with valid
      parameters" --timeout 60000 2>&1 | tail -40)
  ⎿  bigint: Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used (try npm run rebuild?)
     … +49 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Wait, the error is coming from CP-AMM, not fee_router! The setupPolicy test doesn't even touch the
  pool, yet it's calling CP-AMM. This means the CP-AMM program ID is wrong. The test is calling
  ASmKWt93JEMHxbdE6j7znD9y2FcdPboCzC3xtSTJvN7S but it's getting InstructionFallbackNotFound.

  Let me check if the CP-AMM was built with the local feature properly:

      tests/createConfig.test.ts --timeout 60000 2>&1 | grep -E "passing|failing")
  ⎿    3 passing (246ms)

⏺ Good! The CP-AMM tests pass, so the program is working. The issue must be specific to fee_router. Let
  me check if the fee_router program has the correct discriminator. Actually, let me look at what
  instruction is failing - it looks like it's calling the CP-AMM (ASmKWt...) but the fee_router test
  calls setupPolicy which shouldn't touch CP-AMM at all. Let me trace through the test more carefully:

⏺ Bash(grep -n "setupPolicy\|5B57SJ3g" tests/bankrun-utils/feeRouter.ts | head -20)
  ⎿  37:  "5B57SJ3g2YoNXUpsZqqjEQkRSxyKtVTQRXdgAirz6bio"
     233:export async function setupPolicy(
     245:    .setupPolicy({

⏺ Read(tests/bankrun-utils/feeRouter.ts)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

⏺ Now I see! The setupPolicy function calls program.methods.setupPolicy() - this is calling the
  fee_router program (5B57...). But the error message shows ASmKWt... (CP-AMM) is being invoked and
  failing with InstructionFallbackNotFound. This is very strange.

  Wait - let me look at the logs again. The error shows Program 
  ASmKWt93JEMHxbdE6j7znD9y2FcdPboCzC3xtSTJvN7S invoke [1] and then InstructionFallbackNotFound. But the
  setup_policy test doesn't call CP-AMM at all. Unless... let me check if the wrong program ID is being
  used somewhere:

⏺ Bash(grep "declare_id" programs/fee_router/src/lib.rs)
  ⎿  declare_id!("5B57SJ3g2YoNXUpsZqqjEQkRSxyKtVTQRXdgAirz6bio");

⏺ Bash(cat target/idl/fee_router.json | jq '.address' )
  ⎿  "ASmKWt93JEMHxbdE6j7znD9y2FcdPboCzC3xtSTJvN7S"

⏺ AHA! There's the problem! The IDL has the wrong program address. The IDL says ASmKWt... (CP-AMM's
  address) but the program's declare_id says 5B57... (fee_router's address). This means the IDL was
  generated incorrectly or wasn't regenerated after a change. Let me regenerate the IDL:

⏺ Bash(anchor build -- --features local 2>&1 | grep -E "Compiling|Finished|Error" | head -20)
  ⎿      Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.42s           
         Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s
         Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.25s

⏺ Bash(cat target/idl/fee_router.json | jq '.address')
  ⎿  "5B57SJ3g2YoNXUpsZqqjEQkRSxyKtVTQRXdgAirz6bio"

⏺ Perfect! The IDL now has the correct address. Let me run the tests again:

⏺ Bash(pnpm exec ts-mocha tests/feeRouter.test.ts --timeout 120000 2>&1 | grep -E
      "passing|failing|^\s+✔|^\s+\d+\)")
  ⎿       1) Should successfully initialize honorary position with quote-only pool (collectFeeMode = 1)
          2) Should successfully initialize honorary position with quote-only pool (collectFeeMode = 1,
     flipped tokens)
    … +11 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



⏺ Great progress! Now 4 tests are passing (policy tests all pass). Let me check what's failing with the
  initialize tests:

⏺ Bash(pnpm exec ts-mocha tests/feeRouter.test.ts --grep "Should successfully initialize honorary position
      with quote-only pool \(collectFeeMode = 1\)$" --timeout 6000…)
  ⎿ [2025-10-14T15:07:16.587686000Z DEBUG solana_runtime::message_processor::stable_log] Program 111111

    … +21 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



⏺ Good! Now we're getting the actual error: QuoteOnlyValidationFailed - the validation is correctly
  running. The test is passing quoteMint: tokenBMint and the pool has tokenAMint and tokenBMint with
  collectFeeMode = 1. Based on our fix, mode 1 should match pool.token_b_mint == expected_quote_mint,
  and in the test, quoteMint = tokenBMint and the pool's tokenBMint = tokenBMint, so they should match!

  Let me trace through the logic more carefully. In the test, we create the pool with:
  - tokenAMint: tokenAMint (test's tokenA)
  - tokenBMint: tokenBMint (test's tokenB)
  - collect_fee_mode: 1

  Then we call initializeHonoraryPosition with:
  - quoteMint: tokenBMint
  - pool with token_b_mint = tokenBMint

  So the validation should check: pool.token_b_mint == quoteMint which is tokenBMint == tokenBMint =
  TRUE. But it's failing! Let me check if there's a different issue. Let me add some debugging by
  temporarily outputting the pool state:

  Actually, wait. Let me reconsider the actual CP-AMM behavior more carefully. Let me re-read the
  FeeMode logic to confirm I understood it correctly:

  From earlier I saw:
  (CollectFeeMode::OnlyB, TradeDirection::AtoB) => (false, false), // fees_on_token_a = false
  (CollectFeeMode::OnlyB, TradeDirection::BtoA) => (true, false),  // fees_on_token_a = false

  So fees_on_token_a = false for both trade directions when mode is OnlyB. This means fees are NOT
  collected in token_a. Looking at the full struct:
  FeeMode {
      fees_on_input: bool,
      fees_on_token_a: bool,
      has_referral: bool,
  }

  When fees_on_token_a = false, fees are collected in token_b!

  So my fix was correct: mode 1 (OnlyB) collects fees in token_b. The issue must be something else. Let
  me check if maybe the pool state isn't what I think it is. Let me look at the test one more time and
  trace through it very carefully:

  The test creates:
  1. tokenAMint (a token)
  2. tokenBMint (another token)
  3. Pool with those exact mints and collectFeeMode=1
  4. Calls initializeHonoraryPosition with quoteMint=tokenBMint

  And the validation checks: pool.token_b_mint == quoteMint

  This should be TRUE because pool.token_b_mint was set to tokenBMint and quoteMint is tokenBMint!

  Unless... wait, let me check if there's a mismatch between the parameters passed to initializePool and
   what ends up in the pool struct. The issue might be in how initializePool assigns the mints.

  Let me check the order of parameters in the initializePool function and how they're mapped to the
  pool:

⏺ Bash(grep -A 30 "pub async fn initializePool" tests/bankrun-utils/cpAmm.ts | head -40)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ The grep didn't return output. Let me check the actual CP-AMM helper file structure:

⏺ Bash(grep -n "initializePool\|InitializePoolParams" tests/bankrun-utils/cpAmm.ts | head -10)
  ⎿  519:export type InitializePoolParams = { 
     530:export async function initializePool(
     532:  params: InitializePoolParams
     … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Bash(grep -n "export.*initializePool" tests/bankrun-utils/index.ts)
  ⎿  No matches found

⏺ Read(tests/bankrun-utils/cpAmm.ts)
  ⎿  Read 60 lines

⏺ Perfect! I can now see the issue. Looking at line 573-579 (the .initializePool() call), I can see that
   the helper passes:
  - tokenAMint: tokenAMint
  - tokenBMint: tokenBMint

  And at line 94-95, it validates:
  - expect(poolState.tokenAMint.toString()).eq(tokenAMint.toString());
  - expect(poolState.tokenBMint.toString()).eq(tokenBMint.toString());

  So the pool is correctly created with tokenAMint as token_a and tokenBMint as token_b.

  BUT, the test passes quoteMint: tokenBMint which is correct for mode 1 (OnlyB collects in tokenB).

  The issue must be that the pool's collect_fee_mode is not being set correctly, or there's a mismatch
  in how the pool is stored vs how we're reading it.

  Actually, wait - I just realized something. I need to carefully trace through what's happening. The
  test creates a pool with collectFeeMode = 1 in the CONFIG, but does the pool actually get created with
   that mode? Let me check the CP-AMM's initialize_pool logic to see if it reads the collect_fee_mode
  from the config and sets it on the pool.

  Since this is taking too long, let me propose a summary and next steps to the user:
